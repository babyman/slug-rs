# Source benchmark baseline — 2026-09-16

This is the initial end-to-end performance baseline for the Slug VM
optimization work. It is local evidence for comparing later runs on this
machine; it is not a portable performance claim or a timing-sensitive test.

## Environment

| Field                              | Value                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Slug runtime revision              | `e9ae658ef9553dc6b5c72c29323a2bfd3250de98` |
| Slug executable                    | `target/release/slug`                      |
| Slug version                       | `slug-vm 0.1.0`                            |
| CPython executable                 | `/usr/bin/python3`                         |
| CPython version                    | `Python 3.9.6`                             |
| Warmup runs per runtime/workload   | 3                                          |
| Timed samples per runtime/workload | 15                                         |
| Reported statistic                 | Median wall-clock duration                 |

`make bench-source` builds the Slug release executable, then starts one fresh
Slug or CPython process per sample. Timings therefore include process startup,
source loading and compilation, and program execution. Each workload pair is
validated against checked expected output before timing.

## Results

| Workload      | Slug median | CPython median | Slug / CPython |
|---------------|------------:|---------------:|---------------:|
| function-call |  152.707 ms |      32.870 ms |          4.65x |
| n-body        |   54.808 ms |      23.096 ms |          2.37x |
| spectral-norm |   17.603 ms |      21.243 ms |          0.83x |
| binary-trees  |  157.917 ms |      30.097 ms |          5.25x |

Values below `1.00x` mean Slug was faster in this run. The workload corpus is
Benchmark-Game-inspired rather than an upstream corpus port; see
[`benchmarking.md`](benchmarking.md) for its current scope and invocation.

## Interpretation

The first tuning targets are call/frame overhead and allocation-heavy
collection workloads. The nested numeric workload does not justify prioritizing
floating-point dispatch changes without more focused evidence. Future reports
should append a dated comparison rather than replace this baseline.
